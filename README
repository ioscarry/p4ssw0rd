p4ssw0rd analyzes the given password, and gives a worst-time crack based on
known mutations used by password crackers and recovery software.

This is intended to check against offline attacks in a typical situation, where
passwords are salted and hashed with SHA-1 a single time. Crack time is based
on 1,000,000,000 guesses per second (a single modern GPU).

Entropy is not considered, since this is doing full dictionary attack simulation.

Process:
    Dictionary: Passwords
        Binary search for exact match
    Dictionary: Common words                    $$p-4-S-S-w-0-r-d2008$$
        Do leet replacements                    $$p-a-S-S-w-o-r-d2008$$ (leet found)
        Remove delimiters                       $$paSSword2008$$ (delimiter found)
        Strip off border non-alpha characters   paSSword (prepend found, append found)
        Convert to lower                        password (two upper found in middle)
        Binary search for exact match           password (word found in common words after 10 lines)
        Match found:
            Continue for append and prepend
        Else
            Repeat with substring until found or len < 2
    Digits:
        Check for date pattern
        Check for common numbers (666, 777, 420, etc)
        Check for duplicated numbers (5555555)
        Check for consecutive characters (123456)
    Non-dictionary
        Check graph length on keyboard and number of turns
    Border Characters
        Check for mirrored                      $$ == $$ (found)
        Check for duplicated characters         $$ (found)
