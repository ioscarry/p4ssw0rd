p4ssw0rd analyzes the given password, and gives a worst-time crack based on
known mutations used by password crackers and recovery software.

This is intended to check against offline attacks in a typical situation, where
passwords are salted and hashed with SHA-1 a single time. Crack time is based
on 1,000,000,000 guesses per second (a single modern GPU).

Entropy is not considered, since this is doing full dictionary attack simulation.
